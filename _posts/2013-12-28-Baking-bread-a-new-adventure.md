There's a certain gratification when working with your hands and getting physically involved in the process. Maybe I'm just old school. I love driving stick shift. I love tinkering with my bicycle. I love sharpening my kitchen knives by hand. Maybe it's because I get to see the physical cause and effect of everything I do.  There's also a yearning for the days of old, when artisans are respected for their dedication into a single purpose.

And so, I'm fascinated by bread and the history of bread making. It's a food with one of the oldest histories, yet modern biology and chemistry are only beginning to understand the intricate workings of the gluten strands and the delicate fermentation that are invisible to our eyes. 

From slapping the sticky flour mess on the counter, to sliding the nicely proofed dough into the oven, there's physical involvement every step of the way. Though the process is tedious, and the results highly variable, there's a real sense of accomplishment that I was able to put some tasteless ingredients together to make a warm, rustic baguette.

As I delve deeper into baking more bread, I hope to better understand the sensitive effects of time, temperature, and ingredient ratios. I hope to contribute to bringing back this time honored tradition to bake bread for my family and friends and bring smiles to their faces with simple, delicious bread.
